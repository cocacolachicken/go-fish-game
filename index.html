        <p>The rules of Go Fish:<br>
            Each player gets dealt 5 cards. Pairs that you have in your hand are automatically sorted. <br>
            Click on one of the cards to play that card. If the opponent has a card of the same rank, you will take that card
            and it will be collected as a pair. Or else, "Go Fish" a card. If the rank of the card just pulled matches one of the
            other cards in your hand, you will sort them into a pair. <br>
            Your opponent will repeat the same after you make a move, except with their hand. They may think for a while before
            making their move. <br>
            The game will end when both of your hands are empty and there are 26 pairs in total.
